Predicting False Tax Returns with Data: A Zambian Case

Tax fraud is a pervasive issue that affects governments, tax authorities, and taxpayers. One common form of tax fraud is under-reporting income or misrepresenting financial information on tax declarations, which can erode the government's revenue base and create an unfair burden on honest taxpayers. To combat this problem effectively, tax authorities and financial institutions are increasingly turning to advanced technologies, including unsupervised machine learning, to detect and prevent tax fraud. Unsupervised machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that excels at discovering hidden patterns or anomalies in data without the need for predefined labels or guidance. 
In the context of tax fraud detection, unsupervised machine learning offers several advantages, including anomaly detection, scalability, continuous learning, and reduced false positives. The primary objective of this study is to explore the application of unsupervised machine learning in tax fraud detection, with a specific focus on identifying under-reported declarations. Key aspects of this study include data preprocessing, unsupervised algorithms, model evaluation, case studies, and future directions. By leveraging the power of advanced technologies, tax authorities can enhance their ability to identify and prevent fraudulent activities, ensuring fair taxation and revenue collection.
Objectives
•	The study aims to identify under-reporting declarations and improve tax compliance and revenue collection by utilizing unsupervised machine learning techniques.
•	Assessing tax fraud prevalence, reviewing detection methods, gathering data, exploring unsupervised machine learning algorithms, focusing on feature engineering, evaluating metrics, analyzing false positives, assessing scalability, discussing ethical considerations, and summarizing key findings.
•	The research findings will be shared through publications, reports, or presentations to benefit tax authorities, financial institutions, and the broader community interested in tax fraud prevention.
•	By utilizing unsupervised machine learning, the study aims to identify and prevent under-reporting declarations, ultimately contributing to improved tax compliance and revenue collection.
